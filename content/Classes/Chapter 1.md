Tangent is from latin word, tangens, meaning touching.
So, a tangent to a curve means that a line (tangent line) touches the curve.
The Tangent line should have the same direction as the curve at the point of contact.
For circles, one can simply state that a tangent is a line intersecting the circle only once, such as in Figure 1(a).


This definition is not adequate for compmlicated curves. Seen in Figure 1(b).

Let's try to find the tangent line, t, to the parabola, y=x2, in Example 1.'
